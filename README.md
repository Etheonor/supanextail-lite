## Welcome to SupaNexTail Lite!

### What is SupaNexTail?

SupaNexTail is a boilerplate to quickly create a MVP for a SaaS. The current stack is Next.js, Supabase, TailwindCSS, and Stripe. This lite version is globally the frontend without the backend and the different connections (auth/dashboard/stripe/blog...)

### How can I use it?

Simply follow the installation process. For the lite version, you'll just have to copy the project on your computer, and type npm run dev in your terminal at the root of the project.
For the full version, you'll need to have some knowledge with React and know how to set up a database on Supabase.

The documentation of the full version is available [here](https://doc.supanextail.dev/).

### Lite Version

SupaNexTail Lite focuses only on the frontend, to give you an idea of what the full version contains. But if you're not interested in the backend (Supabase / Stripe / Blog etc.) this is also a very good starting point!
